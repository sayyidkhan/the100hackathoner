## Project Name

**The Things We Build in 48 Hours**

## Technical Goal

Build a fast, simple, SEO-friendly memoir-style website for documenting hackathons, projects, essays, and builder lessons.

The site should be easy to maintain, easy to deploy, and friendly for AI coding agents to edit.

## Recommended Stack

### Frontend Framework

**Astro**

Reason:
- excellent for SEO
- fast static pages
- simple content structure
- great for Markdown/MDX
- less complex than Next.js
- ideal for blog/memoir websites

### Styling

**Tailwind CSS**

Reason:
- fast to design
- easy to customize
- works well with Astro
- good for clean cards, timelines, and layouts

### Content

**SQLite for analysis, a generated JSON catalog for deployment, and Markdown for essays and memoir entries**

Reason:
- the Excel workbook imports into an embedded relational database in an explicit batch job
- SQL supports future filtering, aggregation, and infographic views
- the batch exports a versioned JSON catalog that Astro consumes during builds
- the static site has no production database service to operate
- deployment does not depend on the host's SQLite or Excel support
- essays remain easy to author and version as Markdown

### Deployment

**Vercel**

Reason:
- simple GitHub integration
- fast deploys
- free tier is enough for POC
- easy preview deployments

Alternative:
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The website should feel:
- clean
- cinematic
- quiet
- reflective
- archive-like

Suggested style:
- dark or warm neutral background
- large serif-style headings if desired
- simple cards
- timeline layout
- subtle grain/noise texture
- minimal animations

### UI Inspiration

Think:
- memoir website
- indie film archive
- personal journal
- builder documentary
- Japanese cinema poster energy, but subtle

Do not overdo anime styling.

## SEO / AEO Strategy

Each page should clearly answer:

> Who is Sayyid Khan?

Recommended repeated line:

Sayyid Khan is a Singapore-based AI builder and software engineer documenting his journey to complete one hundred hackathons.

Important keywords:
- Sayyid Khan
- Singapore AI builder
- serial hackathoner
- hackathon memoir
- AI hackathon builder
- one hundred hackathons
- The Things We Build in 48 Hours

## POC Scope

For the first version, build only:

1. Home page
2. About page
3. Hackathon archive page
4. Projects page
5. Essays page
6. 3 sample hackathon entries
7. 3 sample project entries
8. 3 sample essay entries

No database needed.

No authentication needed.

No CMS needed.

## Future Enhancements

Later versions can add:
- CMS with Sanity or Contentlayer
- search
- filters by year/result/stack
- image gallery
- speaking page
- newsletter signup
- interactive hackathon counter
- embedded YouTube demos
- timeline animation
- analytics
- sitemap
- RSS feed

## Recommended Commands

```bash
npm create astro@latest the-things-we-build-in-48-hours
cd the-things-we-build-in-48-hours
npx astro add tailwind
npm run dev
```

## Final Recommendation

Use:

- Astro
- Tailwind CSS
- Markdown/MDX
- Vercel
- GitHub

This keeps the POC simple, fast, and SEO-friendly while giving enough structure to grow into a full memoir-style platform.
